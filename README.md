# AYB Hackathon 2021 Project

Hey there! :wave:

This is a project I made for [AYB](https://discord.gg/58WfreXK)'s 2021 Hackathon. Out of the categories, I decided to go with Bot -> Economy, and decided to learn slash commands throughout the project. Prior to this, I hadn't actually used slash commands before so it was quite fun to learn while competing :smile:.

### **Note:** This bot is intended for use in one (1) guild

## Setup Instructions:
For instructions on how to get started with hosting the bot, see below -

1. Install prerequisite software if you do not already have it -
    * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
    * [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
2. Clone this repository - ``git clone https://github.com/Aesth3tical/AYB-Hackathon-2021``
3. Make a copy of ``.env.example`` file in your bot workspace, taking off the ``.example`` portion and fill it in -
4. Don't forget to save before continuing!
5. Open a console/terminal and run ``npm run build``, followed by ``npm run start`` when that's done.
6. If the output looks similar to the screenshot below, your bot should be responsive!
