# AYB Hackathon 2021 Project

Hey there! :wave:

This is a project I made for [AYB](https://discord.gg/58WfreXK)'s 2021 Hackathon. Out of the categories, I decided to go with Bot -> Economy, and decided to learn slash commands throughout the project. Prior to this, I hadn't actually used slash commands before so it was quite fun to learn while competing :smile:.

For instructions on how to get started with hosting the bot, see below -

1. Install prerequisite software if you do not already have it -
    * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
    * [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
2. Clone this repository - ``git clone https://github.com/Aesth3tical/AYB-Hackathon-2021``
3. Create a ``.env`` file in your bot workspace and put in the following values -
```
TOKEN=your_bot_token
MONGO=your_mongodb_connection_uri
CLIENTID=your_bot_client_id
```
